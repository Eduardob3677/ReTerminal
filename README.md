# FAQ

### **Q: Why do I get a "Permission Denied" error when trying to execute a binary or script?**
**A:** This happens because ReTerminal runs on the latest Android API, which enforces **W^X restrictions**. Since files in `$PREFIX` or regular storage directories can't be executed directly, you need to use one of the following workarounds:

---

### **Option 1: Use the Dynamic Linker (for Binaries)**
If you're trying to run a binary (not a script), you can use the dynamic linker to execute it:

```bash
$LINKER /absolute/path/to/binary
```

âœ… **Note:** This method won't work for **statically linked binaries** (binaries without external dependencies).

---

### **Option 2: Use `sh` for Scripts**
If you're trying to execute a shell script, simply use `sh` to run it:

```bash
sh /path/to/script
```

This bypasses the need for execute permissions since the script is interpreted by the shell.

---

### **Option 3: Use Shizuku for Full Shell Access (Recommended)**
If you have **Shizuku** installed, you can gain shell access to `/data/local/tmp`, which has executable permissions. This is the easiest way to run binaries without restrictions.
